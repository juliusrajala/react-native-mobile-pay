# React-native Mobile Pay

This is a work in progress implementation of a Mobile Pay AppSwitch SDK wrapper for React Native.

It is based on [madsleejensen's original implementation](https://github.com/madsleejensen/react-native-mobilepay/) and updated with a more recent version of the AppSwitch SDK to fix issues with versioning.

## Getting started

`$ npm install react-native-mobile-pay --save`

### Mostly automatic installation

`$ react-native link react-native-mobile-pay`

## Usage

```javascript
import RnMobilePay from "react-native-mobile-pay";

// TODO: What to do with the module?
RnMobilePay;
```
